TITLE: Incomplete or Missing Grades Policy
If no grade is submitted by the instructor, a temporary notation “X” is recorded. The final grade must be submitted within 30 days from the start of the next semester. If the instructor is unable to submit a grade within that time, the Dean—after consulting with faculty—will assign the final grade.

TITLE: Withdrawal Procedures and Proof of Withdrawal
Students must officially withdraw through the Office of the Registrar for a “W” grade.
The withdrawal receipt from the Registrar’s Office should be kept as official proof.
Stopping attendance without official withdrawal may result in a letter grade (A–F) assignment if the student does not qualify for an “I.”
